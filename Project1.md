# 🌐 WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS

## 📘 Project Description
In this project, we implemented a **LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)** on an **AWS EC2 instance**.  
The goal is to deploy a simple web application on a virtual server using cloud infrastructure.  
This setup demonstrates how a full web stack can be configured from scratch, including server provisioning, software installation, and connectivity testing.

The project covers:
- Launching an EC2 instance in AWS.
- Installing and configuring Apache Web Server.
- Installing MySQL for database management.
- Setting up PHP to serve dynamic web pages.
- Hosting a sample PHP application to verify the stack functionality.
