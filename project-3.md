# 📝 SIMPLE TO-DO APPLICATION USING MERN STACK

## 🌐 Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a **To-Do Application** built on the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.  
The goal is to create a simple yet functional To-Do list app that allows users to:
- Add new tasks  
- View all existing tasks  
- Delete completed tasks  

The backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) handles API requests and data persistence, while the frontend (React) provides an interactive user interface.  
The entire project is deployed and tested on an **Ubuntu EC2 instance**.
